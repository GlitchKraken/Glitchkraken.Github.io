        <h2>Hunt The Wumpus!</h2>
        <h3 class="folder">2019 Spring Semester - Making a Game with AI Assist</h3>
          This was probably one of my favorite school projects, by a long shot! This one is much easier to show off than it is 
          to explain, so the text part of this blog section will probably be rather short.
        <br><br>
        The topic wasn't too simple: "Create an interactive webpage that keeps score, state, etc per-user... and also makes use of another project of yours."
        For whatever reason, I took this as a challenge- and elected, of all things, to have my webpage make use of an AI I wrote for a game-theory/AI class.
        <br><br>
        The game's Name was "Hunt The Wumpus", and a simple version of its board-state is shown below.<br><br>
        <img src="/blog/wumpus/WumpusLair.png" alt="The Wumpus Board" class ="ExamplePhoto">
        <br><br>
        The Game-Theory Idea of "Hunt The Wumpus" we implemented was a simple one. 
        You start, safely, in the bottom left of the board, and want to grab the gold that has spawned randomly in one of the rooms given.
        <br><br>
        The trick is that, also randomly spawned, is 1 killable wumpus, and several pits- and you only get generic percepts 
        to detect them- "you feel a breeze", "you smell a stinky wumpus nearby"-  you are given no direction for those percepts.
        <br><br>
        The hardest part, by a long shot, was getting the AI from C++ to Javascript with no weirdness happening. 
        took a fair bit of learning JS "quirks!"
        <br><br>
        <img src="/blog/wumpus/WumpusAISneakPeak.png" alt="AI code" class ="ExamplePhoto">
        <br><br>
        The Basic Idea was to have the bot check its percepts at the beggining of each turn, while marking each room it went through.
        "Safe/Unsafe/NewlySave", for example.
        If any room was deemed too risky, it would pop off of a stack and revert its steps, reconsidering old rooms where necessary.
        <br><br>
        Since the other half was web-design, we had to allow the player some control over difficulty, and we decided that
        toggling the AI, help-board, rules/hints was difficult enough! this was fairly easy to implement in JS through
